# minesweeperAI

This is my school project on creating an AI for the Minesweeper game using a SAT solver. Through this project, I was able to apply my knowledge of artificial intelligence and logic programming to solve a classic game using a unique approach. Check out my repository to see the code and documentation of the project.
